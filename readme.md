Simple, fast, open software.

Quicbit software is organized on GitHub by programming language.  We are in the early stages of creating and expanding
the base software, starting with Javascript.

# Announcement

Quicbit libraries have been skillfully crafted by software engineers using ancient, well-worn, classical,
hand-tooled, functions.  They are specially designed to reside unobtrusively within your sensible application, 
to be split up and integrated with incomprehensible libraries when your company gets bought.\*
