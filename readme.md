# Quicbit Inc

Simple, fast, open software.

Software frameworks come and go at breakneck speed.  At Quicbit, we believe that the software 
you build should last.  The technologies you trust should be durable with minimum commitment 
to trendy technology.  That is why we provide most software capabilities as open libraries of 
functions, not frameworks.  By making open libraries available across languages Quicbit 
solutions can be reassembled into other products and endure as long as the software 
languages themselves.

## Software Repositories

Quicbit software is organized on GitHub by programming language.  All Quicbit libraries are available
in javascript for browser and web availability.  Libraries that benefit from optimization will be 
made available in C and ports to other languages with then follow.

* [quicbit-js](http://github.com/orgs/quicbit-js)
* [quicbit-c](http://github.com/orgs/quicbit-c)

* [quicbit-java](http://github.com/orgs/quicbit-java) (to be built) 

# Announcement

Quicbit libraries have been skillfully crafted by software engineers using ancient, well-worn, classical,
hand-tooled, functions.  They are specially designed to reside unobtrusively within your sensible application, 
to be split up and integrated with incomprehensible libraries when your company gets bought.\*
