# Quicbit Inc

Simple, fast, open software.

Software frameworks come and go at breakneck speed.  At Quicbit, we believe that the software 
you build should last.  The technologies you trust should be durable with minimum commitment 
to trendy technology.  That is why we provide most software capabilities as open libraries of 
functions, not frameworks.  By making open libraries available across languages Quicbit 
solutions can be reassembled into other products and endure as long as the software 
languages themselves.

Our first available library is a simple test kit that we use for our own products under development.  If you use javascript and want to write concise tests with minimum framework fuss, give it a try:

Thatâ€™s just a simple test kit.  The products we are testing with it are currently under development.  Check back with us for updates!  Happy development!

## Software Repositories

Quicbit software is organized on GitHub by programming language.  We are in the early stages of creating and expanding
the base software, starting with Javascript.

* [quicbit-js](http://github.com/orgs/quicbit-js)
* [quicbit-c](http://github.com/orgs/quicbit-c) (to be built) 
* [quicbit-py](http://github.com/orgs/quicbit-py) (to be built) 
* [quicbit-java](http://github.com/orgs/quicbit-java) (to be built) 

# Announcement

Quicbit libraries have been skillfully crafted by software engineers using ancient, well-worn, classical,
hand-tooled, functions.  They are specially designed to reside unobtrusively within your sensible application, 
to be split up and integrated with incomprehensible libraries when your company gets bought.\*
